schema_builder.py

# How do I run it?

1. Open terminal and navigate to where your build script is located.
2. Type python schema_builder.py
3. Your terminal will say "JSON schema written to:"
4. Now you have a file called mega_schema.json
5. You want to run this anytime you add another system prompt to the list.

# How do I use the schema? For what?

1. This schema is used to allow your tool that youre making the luxury of not having to look through files for a system prompt.
2. In my case, I'm building a prompt rewriter. The user will select 1 of 24 IDE's from a dropdown menu and then provide a prompt. The IDE they choose from the dropdown should be the one they normally use. The prompt they write should be the problem they want to solve or tool they want to create in their IDE.
3. Once submitted, this tool will take the user prompt and locate the  system prompt for that specific IDE and it will rewrite the users prompt to be the most effective prompt for that specific IDE that it possibly can be simply by formatting it in a way that the system prompt understand most.
4. The results the user will receive from their normal prompt versus this tools version of their prompt will be night and day.
